             <p>This is not the type of breed that you want to cut corners with and if you do you will probably learn a hard lesson. If you plan on owning a Cane Corso as a house dog around your family and friends you need to put temperament first and since all of our dogs are house dogs we know they have great temperaments because we are around them day and night. Also since they are apart of the family we get to see them interact with all types of people, kids, and other different scenario's. This is why we have become so popular and also why most of our puppies sell out well before they are born.

             <p> We are proud to say we utilize the health screening; including certification of not only hips but elbows, hearts, patella and thyroid as well. Our program was one of the first in the US to achieve 100% certified hips in our breeding stock. Because of this foundation, we have been able to produce a large number of the world’s best Pennhip scores for the Breed.  Generations of health testing in our program has greatly bettered the odds against Hip Dysplasia and other common health issues.

            <p>Cane Corsos are a medium-large molossoid, muscular, compact with no unnecessary weight. They are no larger than allowing it to chase at high speeds while still having the power to hold the game. They move with ease. The Cane Corso is a dominant dog with a protective nature, and instinctually aloof, yet easily trained, obedient and devoted to family.

            <p>Often weighing more then 100 pounds, with a large head and alert expression, and muscular fame, Cane Corsos are at a glance intimidating creatures.  Bred as guard dogs for centuries, their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders. As one writer put it, “An understated air of cool competence, the kind of demeanor yo’d expect from a professional bodyguard, is the breed’s trademark” and complete the picture of a dog not to be trifled with.

    <h4>
        Things to Know
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The Corso needs room to play and a proper kennel to be secure in. They require a secure, 6 foot high, heavy duty fenced in area that is NOT accessible by anyone but the family. They are NEVER to be left unsupervised outside of their containment area. This protects the dog from accidental contact with those that are not familiar w/ the breed and avoids unpleasant incidences. They are not an apartment dog. Leaving a Corso crated in the house all day, creates health and temperament problems and should not be done. However, the Corso puppy should be crate trained.</li>
        <li>The Corso requires a respectable amount of socialization and training. Potential owners must be able and dedicated to take the pup out with them to training and socialization.</li>
        <li>The Corso is an up-close and personal type of dog. He bonds very closely with his family.</li>
        <li>Anyone considering a Corso must make sure they are ready to make a lifelong commitment to the dog. The Corso is extremely devoted to its family/owner.
Color is a factor to many new buyers but when determining which Corso is best for you, A corso puppy needs to be chosen based on correct temperament for you, health and correct type.</li>
        <li>If there are children in the home, kids and dogs should not ever be left unattended. Proper boundaries are to be taught to both children and puppy. Owner must be willing to spend the time and be consistent to ensure the relationship between puppy and children is correct. Teach your children that your Corso needs to be respected and always supervise your playtime with children. The Corso can play rough, but they are powerful and strong and sometimes they don’t know their own strength. So use common sense.</li>
        <li>Puppy kindergarten and basic Obedience class is highly recommended. The Corso is a large breed and needs to be under control at all times. Owner needs to be prepared to set aside time to personally take the puppy to class for socialization and training.</li>
        <li>All Corsos possess different personalities like humans, so understand if your Corso is hyper or laid back that is normal progression and adjustment to their unique disposition is part of owning this amazing breed.</li>
        <li>Love and socialize your Corso! Show him or her quality time and have fun! A powerful breed the Corso is, however they are a companion breed and spending time with their family is what they desire more than anything.</li>
        <li>Any traits or behavioral issues you notice at an early age, contact your breeder or trainer and address them swiftly with correction. Don’t allow your Corso to become a bad apple by developing bad habits.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind your Corso will become protective over his property and family. Encourage protective instincts and discourage any prideful behavior by your Corso. Like barking at family members, friends that are regular visitors. Proper training can help in this area, and correction from the owner can contribute to a wonder balanced tempered family companion.</li>
